**Project Idea: Book Review Hub**

The Book Review Hub is a web application that creates a space for book lovers to share their reviews and thoughts about their favorite books, as well as discover new books to read based on other users' reviews.

Here's a detailed rundown of the app's features:

**Home Screen**
- The home page displays options to "Submit a Review", "Browse Reviews", and "Search for a Book".
- There will be a navigation bar at the top with links to "Home", "Submit a Review", "Browse Reviews", "Search for a Book", and "About Us".

**Submit a Review**
- When a user clicks on "Submit a Review", they are directed to a form where they can input details about the book they've read (title, author, genre, their rating, and their review).
- After the review is submitted, it is stored in the MySQL database and the user is provided with a unique URL to their review.

**Browse Reviews**
- On selecting "Browse Reviews", users are presented with a list of all reviews stored in the MySQL database.
- Each review in the list is a clickable link that takes the user to a detailed view of the review.

**Search for a Book**
- If a user chooses "Search for a Book", they can input a book title, author, or genre and the app will return a list of reviews that match their search query.

**Review Details**
- The detailed view of a review includes all the information given by the user who wrote it, as well as an option for other users to comment on the review.
- These comments are stored in the MySQL database and are displayed below the review.

**About Us**
- A static page providing information about the developers and the purpose of the app.

**Styling**
- The app will be styled using HTML, CSS, and potentially Bootstrap to create an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly interface. 
- The design will be responsive to ensure compatibility with a range of devices.
